 Technologies 
 During perform this project, i had used such technologies as: 
 - react context,
 - hooks for function optimization and to have abiliity use functional components, 
 - react memo for components optimization. Also, you will find my usage of typescript instead of ProtoType. 
 
 I used fetch and async / await in order to send, updated and delete elements from API. hopefully you will be satisfy after checking my TODOS list
